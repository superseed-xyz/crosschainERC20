# CrosschainERC20 Advanced Testing Campaign

This testing campaign aims to verify the correctness and security of the CrosschainERC20 system through invariant testing. The campaign focuses on three main components:

1. CrosschainERC20 Token Contract

- Verifying total supply invariants
- Testing minting/burning functionality
- Ensuring proper access controls

2. CrosschainERC20Factory Contract

- Testing deployment logic and uniqueness constraints
- Validating initialization parameters
- Checking CREATE3 deterministic deployment

3. ERC7802Adapter Contract

- Testing bridge integration
- Verifying adapter minting/burning permissions

# Properties

**Legend:**

- `[ ]`: property not yet tested
- `[X]`: tested/proven property
- `[~]`: partially tested/proven property
- `:(`: property won't be tested due to some limitation

| --- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Factory         | The same msg.sender MUST NOT be able to deploy a CrosschainERC20 on the same address as one that he already deployed one using different params on different chains | [X]    |
| 2   | Factory         | Different msg.sender's MUST NOT be able to deploy a CrosschainERC20 on the same address on different chains                                                         | [X]    |
| 3   | Factory         | A CrosschainERC20 MUST NOT be able to be deployed on the same address on different chains using different params                                                    | [X]    |
| 4   | CrosschainERC20 | The total supply of the CrosschainERC20 equals the ERC20 deposited in the lockbox +/- bridged CrosschainERC20 tokens.                                               | [X]    |
| 5   | CrosschainERC20 | The bridge limits MUST NOT be set to a value greater than the max allowed.                                                                                          | [X]    |
